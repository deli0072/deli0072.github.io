   <p>Soufriére Drive-through Volcano 
</p>
   <p>The Soufrière Volcanic Centre is located near the town of Soufrière in southwest Saint Lucia. This is the youngest and only ‘live’ (likely to erupt again) volcanic centre in the island. About 30,000 years ago violent, large explosive eruptions generated large pyroclastic flows and extensive ashfall.

   <p>Pitons Management Area
</p>
   <p>The 2,909-ha site near the town of Soufriere includes the Pitons, two volcanic spires rising side by side from the sea (770 m and 743 m high respectively), linked by the Piton Mitan ridge. The volcanic complex includes a geothermal field with sulphurous fumeroles and hot springs. Coral reefs cover almost 60% of the site’s marine area. A survey has revealed 168 species of finfish, 60 species of cnidaria, including corals, eight molluscs, 14 sponges, 11 echinoderms, 15 arthropods and eight annelid worms. The dominant terrestrial vegetation is tropical moist forest grading to subtropical wet forest, with small areas of dry forest and wet elfin woodland on the summits. At least 148 plant species have been recorded on Gros Piton, 97 on Petit Piton and the intervening ridge, among them eight rare tree species. The Gros Piton is home to some 27 bird species (five of them endemic), three indigenous rodents, one opossum, three bats, eight reptiles and three amphibians.

   <p>The Brig Unicorn
</p>
   <p>The Brig Unicorn was used in the filming of all three Pirates of the Caribbean movies as well as in the series Roots. The Unicorn was built in Finland in 1948. For some time, the 148-feet long vessel had been docked on the Rodney Bay Marina in St. Lucia. The ship has been in St. Lucia since 1980, serving most recently as a bar and restaurant in Rodney Bay Marina.
