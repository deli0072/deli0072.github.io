   <p>Christmas Market 
</p>
   <p>Located in the Aberdeen Square while surrounded by snow-capped heritage buildings and wooden chalets is the Ottawa Christmas Market presented by TD. Thousands of Christmas lights and decorations twinkle and sparkle to create that festive atmosphere that is accompanied by holiday entertainment, local flavours, and, of course, some holiday shopping!

   <p>L'Arc de Triomphe
</p>
   <p>This is a 'folly' placed in the gardens at Moorside, the former summer home of William Lyon Mackenzie King, the tenth Prime Minister of Canada, who salvaged architectural features from demolition sites to decorate the grounds of his summer home located near Kingsmere Lake in the Gatineau Hills. This large arch was formerly the front entrance of a bank. It was erected in 1936.

   <p>Rockcliffe Pavilion
</p>
   <p>The Rockcliffe Pavilion, constructed in 1917, is associated with the Ottawa Improvement Commissionâ€™s efforts to create a National Capital of which Canadians could be proud. Located in Rockcliffe Park, which was established in 1890 at the edge of the city, it constitutes a reminder of the impact of the park movement on Canadian communities in the early 20th century.
