<p>Padua
</p>
<p>Padua, Italian Padova, Latin Patavium, city, Veneto region, northern Italy, on the River Bacchiglione, west of Venice. The Roman Patavium, founded, according to legend, by the Trojan hero Antenor, it was first mentioned in 302 BCE, according to the Roman historian Livy, who was born there (59 BCE). The town prospered greatly and, in the 11thâ€“13th century, was a leading Italian commune. The poet Dante lived there, and St. Anthony of Padua is buried there. It was governed by the Carrara family from 1318 to 1405, when it passed to Venice, which held it until 1797. Under Austrian dominion from 1815 to 1866, it was active in the Risorgimento (movement for Italian independence); a rising took place there in February 1848. It was heavily bombed in World War II, and the frescoes by Andrea Mantegna in the Church of the Eremitani were almost completely destroyed.
