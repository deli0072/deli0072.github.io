   <p>Boston Common 
</p>
   <p>Founded in 1634. Here the Colonial militia mustered for the Revolution. In 1768, the hated British Redcoats began an eight-year encampment. George Washington, John Adams and General Lafayette came here to celebrate our nation's independence. The 1860s saw Civil War recruitment and anti-slavery meetings. During World War I, victory gardens sprouted. For World War II, the Common gave most of its iron fencing away for scrape metal. 

Boston Common continues to be a stage for free speech and public assembly. Here, during the 20th century, Charles Lindbergh promoted commercial aviation. Anti-Vietnam War and civil right rallies were held, including one led by Martin Luther King, Jr. In 1979, Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass.

   <p>Massachusetts State House
</p>
   <p>With its golden dome clearly visible atop Beacon Hill, the Massachusetts State House sits at the western edge of the Boston Common. Charles Bullfinch designed this monumental building, which completed construction in 1798. The Massachusetts State House serves as the home for the State Senate, House of Representatives, and Governor’s Office. Inside, murals, statues and governors’ portraits illustrate the state’s history.

Since its completion, the Massachusetts State House has been a site of debate and discussion. Representatives and members of the public have grappled with the essential principles of justice, liberty, and representation. Those who first struggled to gain access to the building still found ways to ensure their voices would be heard within its walls. Black and White abolitionists petitioned for the end of slavery and against the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law. African Americans petitioned for equal access to education, leading to the State Legislatures’ ban on segregated education in 1855. Women petitioned for greater civil rights, most importantly, the right to vote.
