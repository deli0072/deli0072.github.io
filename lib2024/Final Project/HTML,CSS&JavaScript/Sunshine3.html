   <p>Prague
</p>
<p>Prague, Czech Praha, city, capital of the Czech Republic. Lying at the heart of Europe, it is one of the continent’s finest cities and the major Czech economic and cultural centre. The city has a rich architectural heritage that reflects both the uncertain currents of history in Bohemia and an urban life extending back more than 1,000 years.

<p>Astronomical Clock
</p>
<p>The mediaeval tower clock is located at the southern side of the Old Town Hall Tower. When the clock strikes the hour (from 9.00 a.m. to 11.00 p.m.), the procession of the Twelve Apostles sets in motion. The parade of the Apostles is visible from the Old Town Square. If you want to see them better, we recommend you to buy a ticket to the Old Town Hall, where you can admire them from the tower´s chapel.

The astronomical clock was placed at the front side of the tower in 1410. At the southern part of the tower a special stone chamber was built for its mechanical part. The astronomical clock consists of different parts – such as a calendar and an astronomical desk or the mechanism of twelve apostles which sets them in motion.

During the apostles’ parade, other figures placed on the sides of the astronomical clock set in motion too. The skeleton rings, rotates an hourglass in order to show to the Turk that his lifetime is at the end. He shakes his head. The Vain Man and the Miser behave similarly.

<p>St. Vitus Cathedral
</p>
<p>The Gothic Cathedral is an exceptional achievement. The structure, dark with age and solemnity, was meant not only as the principle church of the Castle but also as the spiritual centre of the whole country.
  The original Romanesque Rotunda of St. Vitus was founded in the second decade of the 10th century by St. Wenceslas in order to house a gift from Emperor Henry the Fowler, the shoulder of St. Vitus, a defender of the Holy Roman Empire and henceforth also a patron saint of Bohemia. He built it on the highest place in Prague Castle and by doing so he determined forever the layout of the secular and religious buildings in the third courtyard. The Romanesque Rotunda, where St. Wenceslas himself was buried and also St. Vojtěch the second Prague bishop, was soon unable to accommodate all the believers visiting the holy relics. Prince Spytihněv had it demolished and in its place started to build a 70 metre long basilica, completed in the reign of his successor Prince Vratislav II who was crowned Bohemian King here in 1085. In the basilica other rulers were also crowned, the last one being John of Luxembourg and his wife Eliška Přemislide. Their son Wenceslas was christened in the Cathedral, and later at his confirmation accepted the name Karel (Charles). It is Charles as king and emperor, who deserves recognition for the building of the Gothic Cathedral.
